    "# The pH scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to specify the degree of auto-ionization of water. Water is important in biochemistry because of its micro and macroscopic properties including amphotericity, polarity, density anomolies, and colligative properties which ultimately influence its behavior as a `universal solvent`. Molecules either dissolve well in water, or they don't, and both of those types of molecules serve important functions in cells. When the solvent properties of water change, it can have dramatic effects on the stability and behavior of biomolecules. \n",
