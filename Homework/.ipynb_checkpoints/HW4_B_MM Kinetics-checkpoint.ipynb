    "The Michaelis-Menten rate equation is a cornerstone of enzyme kinetics, offering a mathematical description of how the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction depends on the intrinsic properties of the enzyme as well as concentration of the substrate. The development of this equation from first principles involves several key assumptions and steps, which are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The reaction involves an enzyme (E) binding to a substrate (S) to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES), which then releases a product (P), regenerating the free enzyme. Note that we're using substrate in place of 'product' here in keeping with the original notation in Michaelis and Menten's classic paper for which this kinetic model is named. The model can be represented as two steps:\n",
    "   $$\\textcolor{aquamarine}{E + S \\overset{k_1}{\\underset{k_{-1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\overset{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P}$$\n",
    "   Here, $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$ are the rate constants for the forward reaction, the reverse reaction, and the conversion of ES into E and P, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The concentration of the substrate is much larger than the concentration of the enzyme, allowing us to consider the enzyme concentration as essentially constant during the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The reaction reaches a steady state where the formation rate of the ES complex equals its dissociation rate (into E + S and E + P). This implies that the rate of change of [ES] with time is approximately zero after the initial transient phase."

    "## Review of Key Assumptions of the MM model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Complex Formation**: The model assumes that the reaction involves a simple binary complex formed between the enzyme (E) and the substrate (S), leading to the enzyme-substrate complex (ES). The reaction can be summarized in two main steps:\n",
    "   - The enzyme binds to the substrate to form the ES complex: $E + S \\overset{k_1}{\\rightarrow} ES$.\n",
    "   - The ES complex then either dissociates back into E and S, or proceeds to form the product (P) while releasing the enzyme: $ES \\overset{k_{-1}}{\\rightarrow} E + S$ or $ES \\overset{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steady-State Assumption**: The model assumes that the concentration of the ES complex remains constant over the course of the reaction, after an initial transient phase. This means that the rate of formation of the ES complex equals the rate of its breakdown into either E + S or E + P.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial Substrate Concentration Predominance**: It is assumed that the substrate concentration $([S])$ is much larger than the enzyme concentration $([E])$, allowing the approximation that the substrate concentration remains relatively constant during the initial phase of the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Irreversible Product Formation**: The reaction from ES to E + P is considered to be irreversible under the conditions of the experiment, meaning the product does not convert back into the substrate or form the ES complex under the reaction conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rapid Equilibrium**: Alternatively, in some interpretations, the model can assume that the formation and dissociation of the ES complex reach a rapid equilibrium before the product is formed, characterized by a dissociation constant $(K_d)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Saturability**: The model implies that there is a maximal rate $(V_{max})$ of the reaction, achieved when all enzyme molecules are bound to substrate molecules (i.e., when the enzyme is saturated with substrate). The relationship between reaction rate and substrate concentration follows a hyperbolic curve, reflecting the saturable nature of enzyme activity.\n"
