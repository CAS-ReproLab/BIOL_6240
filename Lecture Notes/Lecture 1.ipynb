    "## Is Life Inevitable?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The earth consists of four concentric spheres of matter. The lithosphere (solid matter), the hydrosphere (liquid matter), the atmosphere (gaseous matter and vapor), and the biosphere (complex crystaline mixtures of liquid and solid matter). \n",
    "* Life is qualitatively different from other 'active' processes we might observe on earth such as volcanic eruptions or lightning strikes.\n",
    "* These phenomena - a biological cell, a volcanic eruption, and lightning - might seem to have nothing in common. However, they are all processes that are in thermodynamic disequilibrium, and that act as `relaxation channels` for the flow of matter. \n",
    "* They form observable patterns that dissipate over time, and each instance of these phenomena is similar to, but not the same as, any other instance.\n",
    "* Life may have been an 'accident' of history with only one distinct origin that is unlikely to happen again. Alternatively, the commonality with the chemical and physical similarities between non-equilibrium flows of matter implies that life may be a reproducible phenomenon that occurs as a consequence of regular geochemical change.\n",
    "* In other words, life may be something that happens `to` a planet, rather than something that happens `on` a planet... "

    "## Structure and Universality of Biochemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first thing to appreciate about life on earth is its organization into metastable ecosystems in which organic molecules are self sufficiently 'recycled'. For example, animals exspire $CO_2$ and respire $O_2$ and plants fix $CO_2$ into glucose, while expiring $O_2$.\n",
    "* Ecosystems consists fundamentally of two types of organisms, autotrophs - fix organic molecules from environmental gases, powered by solar radiation, and heterotrophs - Oxidize organic molecules obtained by consuming autotrophs and other heterotrophs.\n",
    "* There is a core autotrophic metabolism that consists of less than 500 small molecules.\n",
    "* The core metabolism can be broken down into two subcategories, catabolic reactions (neutral or oxidative), and anabolism (reductive).\n",
    "* Reductive anabolism essentially consumes electrons from 'high energy' bonds. It is possible for organisms to consist almost entirely of anabolic reactions (e.g., chemo-autotrophs).\n",
    "* Catabolism evolved in heterotrophs as a way to support anabolism from organic inputs.\n",
    "* Only the anabolic core of intermediry metabolism is truly universal, it is the 11 carboxylic acids of the Krebs cycle. In heterotrophs, the Krebs cycle catalyzes oxidative catabolism of organic molecules and produces $CO_2$, in autotrophs it runs in 'reverse' reducing $CO_2$ to produce organic acids. What we know as the 'forward' Krebs cycle should be called the 'reverse' cycle...\n",
    "* The rest of anabolic metabolism builds from the core set of metabolites. Adding ammonian and reductant (e.g., molecular hydrogen) builds many of the simpler amino acids (e.g., alanine) from the core Krebs cycle organic acids.\n",
    "* The 3 carbon carbohydrates and their 6 and 5 carbon derivatives (e.g., ribose) are derived from pyruvate.\n",
    "* The saturated fatty acids that form lipid membranes are derived from the recursive reduction of C-O bonds of acetate to C-H bonds.\n",
    "* More complex reaction schemes branch out from these core metabolic reactions into a complicated web forming nucleic acids, complex amino acids, cofactors, etc.\n",
    "* All of anabolic metabolism branches off from the simple core metabolism, and a reasonable evolutionary conjecture can be made about the chemcial feasibility and even chronological order of the reactions in this model.\n",
    "* Anabolic reactions from $CO_2$ and a reductant (e.g., molecular hydrogen) are exergonic as a whole, but many of the intermediate reactions require coupled hydrolysis of phosphate polymers to make the net reaction energetically favorable. This likely has not always been in the form of ATP (e.g., inorganic polyphosphates), but largely is today.\n",
    "* Overall, the net cascade of metabolism in an ecosystem acts as a `relaxation channel` for two sources of chemical energy: `electron transfer from reductants and hydrolysis of phosphates`.\n",
    "* Notably, modern organisms no longer need high energy phosphates from their environments, and instead have evolved ways to recycle an internal pool of phosphates using conserved redox reactions such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation."

    "## Catalysis\n",
    "* Life's chemical ensembles are structured by both energetics and kinetics.\n",
    "* Catalysis is essential to the nature of living systems.\n",
    "* Though much of modern biology relies on complex and highly evolved polymers for catalysis, they are not essential for the kinds of reactions that likely supported the formation of core metabolism long ago.\n",
    "* For example, the aldol condensation of glycoaldehyde to tetroses (erythrose and threose) is catalyzed by simple amino acids isovaline and alanine when they are present in enantiomeric excess$^2$.\n",
    "* Catalysis can be achieved by hierarchies of small molecules in the absence of polymers.\n",
    "* Polymer catalysts such as RNA and proteins likely evolved from simpler catalysts over time.\n",
    "* Together, we can describe life in the following way: We begin with a core reductive autotrophy that cascades in complexity as the modern 'relaxation channel' system has 'assembled' itself from previous steps forming a large and complex network of uninterrupted flow of matter through the earths various ecosystems.\n",
    "* Cellular structures likely arose as the most stable and productive form of metabolism, and satisfy a number of constraints including optimal water concentration for polymerization and a diversification of energy transduction systems (e.g., transmembrane potentials). \n",
    "* This model is certainly not the only one that has been proposed, but it is a compact and simple picture that lends itself to reasonable and descriptive chemistry.\n",
    "* It is physically similar to other non-equilibrium geochemical phenomena, but differs in the time stability of its forms, and the scale of its energy transducing elements. "
